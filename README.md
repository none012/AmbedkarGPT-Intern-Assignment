# AmbedkarGPT - AI Intern Task (Windows Version)

AmbedkarGPT is a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer questions based on the speeches of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. This project was developed as part of the Phase 1 Core Skills Evaluation for Kalpit Pvt Ltd.

The system runs entirely offline on your Windows machine using Python 3.11, ChromaDB, and Ollama (Mistral).

📂 Project Structure

main1.py: The core Python script containing the RAG pipeline logic.

speech.txt: The source text file containing the speech excerpt.

requirements.txt: A list of all Python dependencies.

chroma_db/: (Generated automatically) Local directory for storing vector embeddings.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.11 (Windows)

Orchestration: LangChain

LLM: Ollama (Model: mistral)

Embeddings: HuggingFace (sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Vector Database: ChromaDB

📦 Requirements File Content

Create a file named requirements.txt and paste the following lines into it:

langchain==0.3.0 langchain-community==0.3.0 langchain-ollama==0.2.0 langchain-huggingface==0.1.0 langchain-chroma==0.1.4 chromadb sentence-transformers 

🚀 Setup Instructions (Windows)

1. Prerequisites

Install Python 3.11: Ensure it is added to your PATH.

Install Ollama: Download from ollama.com.

2. Model Setup (Crucial)

Open a new Command Prompt window and run the following commands to set up the AI "brain":

ollama serve


(Keep this window open). Then, in a new window:

ollama pull mistral


3. Project Installation

Navigate to your project folder in Command Prompt and run:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt


💻 Usage

Run the main script to start the interactive Q&A system:

python main1.py


🧪 Example Queries & Outputs

Here are actual outputs generated by the system during testing.

Query 1: Understanding the Core Theme

Make a query: what is the speech.txt about
Thinking...

Answer:
The provided text appears to be a quote from Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's speech, discussing the issue of caste in India and emphasizing that the problem lies not only in social reform but also in challenging the authority of the scriptures (shastras) that uphold the caste system. The solution, according to this excerpt, is to question and overthrow the belief in the sanctity of these shastras.


Query 2: Specific Entity Retrieval (Negative Case)

Make a query: who is Ambedkar for this speech
Thinking...

Answer:
I cannot find the answer to your question "who is Ambedkar" in the provided text. The given context only discusses Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's speeches on caste and the shastras, but there is no information provided about his identity or role within this specific text excerpt.


Query 3: Specific Entity Retrieval (Positive Case)

Make a query: who is Dr. B.R. Ambedkar for this speech.txt
Thinking...

Answer:
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar is the author of the speech mentioned in the context provided.


Query 4: Direct Content Extraction

Make a query: What is the real remedy?
Thinking...

Answer:
The real remedy is to destroy the belief in the sanctity of the shastras.


Exiting the System

Make a query: quit
Exiting...


🧠 Code Logic Overview

The core logic resides in main1.py. It follows this pipeline:

Load: Reads speech.txt.

Split: Breaks text into chunks (1000 chars).

Embed: Converts text to numbers using all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

Store: Saves vectors to ./chroma_db.

Retrieve: Finds top 3 matching chunks for your question.

Answer: Sends context + question to Mistral via Ollama.
